        <td class="rh"><p align="justify"><strong>Mumbai:</strong> You have heard of films being plagiarised, music being copied, even outfit designs  being stolen, but these days everyone's talking about a Bollywood stage musical  whose idea and concept has allegedly been duplicated by another musical. <br />
            <br />
            Tongues are wagging that Shilpa  Shetty's musical <em>Miss Bollywood</em>, which recently premiered in Berlin and  is currently touring the UK, is an out-and-out lift of choreographer Vaibhavi  Merchant's successful show <em>Merchants of Bollywood</em> that has been playing  across Europe since 2005. <br />
            <br />
            And there is no denying the fact  that the theme of both shows sounds suspiciously similar. <br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I heard they are doing <em>Miss  Bollywood</em> which is just like my show. I don't know what to say,&rdquo; says  Merchant.<br />
            <br />
            Vaibhavi's show, <em>Merchants of  Bollywood</em> is a semi-autobiographical musical that traces the journey of a  young girl who rebels against her family of classical dancers to make a foray  into Bollywood as a choreographer. Meanwhile,  the Shilpa-starrer <em>Miss Bollywood</em> is a story centered around a young  choreographer trained in classical dance, who struggles to popularise the  Bollywood brand of dancing in the UK. <br />
            <br />
            Shilpa's  musical, produced by the Moranis, received damp reviews after its premiere, and  is playing to empty houses. Meanwhile, Merchant believes there isn't place for  two musicals on a similar theme, and insists she is on the winning foot.<br />
            <br />
            &ldquo;I  definitely have an upper hand because I have been doing <em>Merchants of  Bollywood</em> for the past three years. That's my advantage. But I hope they do  well, I hear their initial show had a lot of glitches,&rdquo; Merchant says.<br />
            <br />
            A  Page 3 celebrity in the UK since winning the <em>Celebrity Big Brother</em> reality show in January, Shilpa was looking for the right international project  to make a splash with in the West. <br />
          With <em>Miss Bollywood</em> she is hoping to raise awareness about the world's  biggest film industry in the West. <br />
          <br />
          &ldquo;Through  this musical we are not only going to entertain them but tell them what  Bollywood films are all about. What our heroes are all about,&rdquo; Shilpa says.<br />
          <br />
          Merchant  may have won Round One, but will Shilpa's star power bring in the crowds, especially  when her show plays in London? Will those very housewives who voted her to  victory on <em>Big Brother</em> embrace her musical as well? <br />
          <br />
          It's  a question that will be answered in the weeks ahead. Round Two on December 12  when <em>Miss Bollywood</em> arrives at the Albert Hall in London.</p>          </td>
